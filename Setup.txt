This base project has been setup with layers to seperate concerns. 
The WebApi project, .Web gets to data via the .Services project. The .Services project in turn marshalls requests via the .Data project, 
specifically via a repository.
The .Data project depends upon the .Data.Models project to define the models. We have separated the .Models project out so we can share 
those with other projects as necessary, for example a UnitTest project or another Web Project.

To make this project work well, it would be best to setup an IIS server and created a dedicated website for it. Here are the steps.
1) Make sure you have IIS installed on your system.
2) Open the IIS manager tool.
3) Expand the "Sites" node and right click to add a new Web Site.
4) Give it a name like "Sort2015".
5) Select the physical path to the Sort2015.Web folder.
6) It would be best to specify a Host Name like "sort-dev". You will need to add a host entry in your c:\Windows\Drivers\Etc\Hosts file of  
		127.0.0.1   sort-dev
7) In the Actions pane on the right, click Edit Permissions for our newly created site.
8) Select the Security tab.
9) Click the Edit... button.
10) Click the Add... button.
11) Type USERS in the big box labeled "Enter the object names to select" and click OK, then closeout the remaining dialogs.
12) Test to make sure everything worked by opening a browser and typing http://sort-dev (or whatever you set in your hosts file) and see if you get a page returned.
